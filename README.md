# Carbon-Footprint-Calculator



A carbon footprint measures the total greenhouse gas emissions caused by an activity, product, person, or organization, usually reported in tonnes of CO₂-equivalent. It includes emissions across the entire life cycle—from production and use to disposal.

For organizations, emissions are categorized as:

### Scope 1: 
Direct emissions (e.g., company vehicles)

### Scope 2: 
Indirect from energy use (e.g., electricity)

### Scope 3:
All other indirect emissions (e.g., supply chains)

The carbon footprint helps compare the climate impact of activities and supports informed decisions to reduce emissions and prioritize low-impact choices.
